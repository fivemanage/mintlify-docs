mTo get the most value out of your logs in Fivemanage or Grafana, it's important to follow consistent logging patterns. This guide covers best practices for structuring your logs and metadata.

## 1. Metadata is King

While the log message tells you _what_ happened, metadata tells you _who_, _where_, and _how_. Always prefer metadata over embedding variables in the message string.

<CodeGroup>

```java Good
// Easy to query: count logs where item_id = 'diamond'
Map<String, Object> metadata = Map.of("player", "Steve", "item_id", "diamond");
FivemanageLogger.info("economy", "Item purchased", metadata);
```


```java Bad
// Hard to query: requires regex or full-text search
FivemanageLogger.info("economy", "Steve purchased a diamond", null);
```

</CodeGroup>

## 2. Consistent Naming Conventions

Use a consistent naming convention for your metadata keys. We recommend using `snake_case`.

- `player_id` instead of `PlayerID` or `playerID`
- `world_name` instead of `world`
- `item_amount` instead of `qty`

## 3. Categorize with Datasets

Think of datasets as high-level categories for your logs. This makes it much easier to organize your dashboards.

| Dataset         | Use Case                                              |
| :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `player-events` | Joins, leaves, deaths, level-ups.                     |
| `economy`       | Transactions, shop purchases, currency changes.       |
| `combat`        | PVP kills, PVE encounters, boss fights.               |
| `admin`         | Command usage, bans, kicks, config changes.           |
| `errors`        | Plugin exceptions, failed API calls, database issues. |

## 4. Log Levels Matter

Use the appropriate log level to help you filter noise in your dashboards.

- **INFO:** Normal server operations (e.g., "Player joined").
- **WARN:** Something unusual happened but the server is still running fine (e.g., "Player tried to use a disabled command").
- **ERROR:** Something failed and needs attention (e.g., "Failed to save player data").
- **DEBUG:** Verbose information for development and troubleshooting.

## 5. Designing for Dashboards

When logging data that you want to visualize:

- **Counters:** Log an event every time something happens (e.g., "Block broken"). In Grafana, you can then use `count()` to see the rate of blocks broken per minute.
- **Gauges:** Log the current state of something (e.g., "Current online players").
- **Timings:** Log how long an operation took in metadata (e.g., `process_time_ms: 45`). This allows you to create heatmaps and latency graphs.

## Example: Tracking Economy

If you want to create a dashboard showing the total currency in circulation:

```java
Map<String, Object> metadata = new HashMap<>();
metadata.put("player_id", player.getUniqueId().toString());
metadata.put("change_amount", 500);
metadata.put("new_balance", 1500);
metadata.put("reason", "quest_reward");
metadata.put("quest_id", "daily_mining");

FivemanageLogger.info("economy", "Balance updated", metadata);
```

In Grafana, you could then easily create a graph of `sum(new_balance)` or see which quests are giving out the most rewards by grouping by `quest_id`.
