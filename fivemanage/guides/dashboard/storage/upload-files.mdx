    If you want specific files to be kept permanently regardless of your team's auto-deletion policies, check the **Retention Exempt** box.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Retention Exemption

By default, Fivemanage may automatically delete older files based on your team's retention settings to help manage storage and costs.

### Why use Retention Exemption?

- **Permanent Assets:** For logos, UI elements, or critical evidence that must never be deleted.
- **Specific Overrides:** Allows you to keep individual files even if your general policy is set to 7 or 30 days.

When a file is marked as exempt, it displays a badge in the dashboard to indicate it will be skipped during automatic cleanup.

## Retention Policies & Quality

You can manage your global retention policies in the **Storage Settings** tab.

- **Per-type Retention:** Set different expiration periods for images, videos, and audio.
- **Image Quality:** Optionally override image quality to optimize for storage space or performance.
