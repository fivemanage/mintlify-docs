Collaboration is at the heart of Fivemanage. You can easily invite your colleagues to your team and manage their access levels as your organization grows.

<Note>
  You must be a team **Owner** or **Admin** to invite or remove members.

## Inviting New Members

Inviting a new member is simple and only requires their email address.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Team Management">
    Navigate to **Settings** > **Manage Team** in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Invite Member">
    Click the **Invite Member** button at the top of the members list.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Email">
    Enter the email address of the person you want to invite and click **Send Invitation**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What happens next?
1. An invitation email is sent to the recipient.
2. The user will appear in your member list as **Pending** until they accept the invitation.
3. Once they accept, they will have default **Member** access (which you can then upgrade to Admin or Developer).

## Managing Existing Members

From the management dashboard, you can see all active and pending members of your team.

### Updating Roles
To change a member's role or customize their permissions, click the **Settings** (gear icon) next to their name. For a full breakdown of what each role can do, see our [Roles & Permissions](/fivemanage/guides/dashboard/team/roles) guide.

### Removing Members
If a team member no longer needs access:
1. Click the **Settings** (gear icon) next to their name.
2. Select **Remove from Team**.
3. Confirm the action in the popup dialog.

<Warning>
  Removing a member is immediate. They will lose access to all team resources, including logs, storage, and API tokens.
</Warning>

## Managing Invitations

If you accidentally sent an invitation to the wrong email or the person is no longer joining your team, you can revoke the invite.

1. Find the pending invitation in the member list.
2. Click the **Revoke** button next to their email.
3. The invitation link will immediately become invalid.
