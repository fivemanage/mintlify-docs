Storage settings allow you to automate the lifecycle of your media assets and optimize how images are stored and served. These settings apply globally to your team but can be overridden for specific files.

## Accessing Settings

To manage your storage configuration:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Storage">
    Navigate to the **Storage** section from your dashboard sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Settings Tab">
    Click on the **Settings** tab located in the storage navigation bar.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Retention Policies

Retention policies help you manage storage costs and comply with data privacy requirements by automatically deleting old files.

### Configuration Options
You can enable or disable retention individually for different media types:

- **Images:** Photos, screenshots, and UI assets.
- **Videos:** Gameplay clips, recordings, and tutorials.
- **Audio:** Voice recordings and sound effects.

### Retention Periods
For each enabled type, you can choose how long files should be kept before automatic deletion:
- 7 days
- 30 days
- 90 days
- 180 days
- 365 days

<Info>
  **Pro-tip:** Use shorter retention periods for temporary assets like bug report screenshots to keep your storage clean.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **Automatic Deletion is Permanent**
  Once a file is deleted by the retention policy, it cannot be recovered. Ensure you use [Retention Exemption](/fivemanage/guides/dashboard/storage/upload-files#retention-exemption) for critical assets.
</Warning>

## Image Quality Settings

Fivemanage allows you to optimize image storage by adjusting the compression level. This is particularly useful for reducing bandwidth usage and improving load times for your end-users.

### Quality Levels
When **Override Image Quality** is enabled, you can set the compression level from **10%** (highest compression, smallest size) to **100%** (lowest compression, original quality).

- **Recommended (50% - 80%):** A good balance between visual clarity and file size.
- **High Performance (10% - 40%):** Best for large-scale applications where load speed is critical and perfect detail is less important.

<Note>
  Quality settings only apply to images uploaded *after* the setting is changed. Existing images will remain at their original quality.
</Note>

## Saving Changes

After adjusting your settings, click the **Save Changes** button at the bottom of the form. A notification will confirm that your team's configuration has been updated.
