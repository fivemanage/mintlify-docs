The Fivemanage SDK provides a robust logging system that can send logs to the Fivemanage cloud, print them to the console, and automatically include player identifiers.

## Server-Side Exports

### `Log`

The primary export for sending logs to a specific dataset.

**Definition:**
```typescript
Log(
    datasetId: string, 
    level: string, 
    message: string, 
    metadata?: { 
        playerSource?: string | number, 
        targetSource?: string | number, 
        [key: string]: unknown 
    }
): void
```

**Usage:**

<CodeGroup>
```lua Lua
exports.fmsdk:Log("economy", "info", "Player purchased an item", {
    playerSource = source,
    item = "Pistol",
    price = 500
})
```

```javascript JavaScript
exports.fmsdk.Log("economy", "info", "Player purchased an item", {
    playerSource: source,
    item: "Pistol",
    price: 500
});
```
</CodeGroup>

### Shorthand Exports

For convenience, the SDK provides shorthands for common log levels. These always send to the specified dataset.

- `Info(datasetId, message, metadata)`
- `Warn(datasetId, message, metadata)`
- `Error(datasetId, message, metadata)`

**Usage:**
```lua
exports.fmsdk:Info("default", "Server started successfully")
exports.fmsdk:Error("anticheat", "Suspicious activity detected", { playerSource = source })
```

### `LogMessage`

A legacy/shorthand export that sends logs to the `"default"` dataset.

```lua
exports.fmsdk:LogMessage("info", "This goes to the default dataset")
```

## Datasets

Datasets allow you to categorize your logs in the Fivemanage dashboard. You can create different datasets for different purposes, such as `economy`, `anticheat`, `admin_actions`, etc.

If a dataset name is provided that doesn't exist, it will be created automatically (depending on your Fivemanage plan/settings).

---

## Automatic Player Identifiers

When you include `playerSource` or `targetSource` in the metadata, the SDK automatically fetches and appends player identifiers (License, Discord, Steam, etc.) to the log entry.

This makes it incredibly easy to track actions back to specific players without manually gathering identifiers every time.

```lua
exports.fmsdk:Log("kills", "info", "Player killed another player", {
    playerSource = killerSource,
    targetSource = victimSource,
    weapon = "CombatPistol"
})
```

## Automatic Event Logging

The SDK can be configured to automatically log common FiveM events. This is managed in the `config.json` file.

Supported automatic events:
- **Player Events**: Connections, disconnections.
- **Chat Events**: All chat messages.
- **Base Events**: Resource starts/stops.
- **txAdmin Events**: Admin actions.
- **ox_inventory**: Item movements, purchases, etc. (if installed).

See the [Configuration](/fivem-sdk/configuration) page for how to enable these.
