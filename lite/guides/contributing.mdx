# Developing & Contributing

Follow these instructions if you want to contribute to the project or build from source.

## Prerequisites

*   **Go**: 1.24 or later
*   **Node.js**: 22.x or later
*   **pnpm**: 9.x or later
*   **Air**: For backend hot-reloading
*   **Docker**: For running local infrastructure

## Initial Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fivemanage/fivemanage-lite.git
    cd fivemanage-lite
    ```

2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd web
    pnpm install
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Download Backend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    go mod download
    ```

4.  **Start Development Infrastructure:**
    This will spin up the required databases (Postgres, ClickHouse, MinIO) in the background.
    ```bash
    docker compose -f deployments/docker-compose.yml up -d
    ```

## Running for Development

Run the backend and frontend in separate terminals.

1.  **Backend:**
    ```bash
    air
    ```

2.  **Frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd web
    pnpm dev
    ```

## Project Structure

*   `cmd/lite`: Main entry point and CLI configuration.
*   `internal/`: Application logic, API handlers, and services.
*   `pkg/`: Reusable packages for storage, logging, and caching.
*   `web/`: Frontend React application.
*   `deployments/`: Docker Compose and deployment configurations.
*   `migrate/`: PostgreSQL schema migrations.
*   `build/`: Dockerfile and build scripts.

## Contributing Guidelines

1.  **Branching:** Use descriptive branch names (`feature/*`, `fix/*`).
2.  **Formatting:** Use `go fmt` and `pnpm lint`.
3.  **Commits:** Provide clear, professional messages.
4.  **Pull Requests:** Provide a detailed description of changes.
