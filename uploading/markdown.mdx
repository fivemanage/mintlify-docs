Before you can start using the Upload API, you need to create an account and get an API key. You can do this by signing up at [Fivemanage ](https://www.fivemanage.com/) and creating a team.

Login to your account and go to the tokens page in the [dashboard ](https://www.fivemanage.com/dashboard).

Create a new token by clicking the “Create token” button. There are a few different types of tokens. If you wish to uplaod all kinds of media, you can choose `Media` or `Logs` for the logs api. You will use this token to authenticate with the API.
