Fivemanage provides several ways to delete files, ranging from individual removal to bulk mass deletion based on date ranges.

<Warning>
  **Deletion is Permanent**
  Deleting files from Fivemanage is irreversible. Once confirmed, the file and its associated data are permanently removed from our servers and cannot be recovered.
</Warning>

## Individual Deletion

If you only need to remove a few specific files, you can do so directly from the storage list or grid view.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Files">
    In the **Storage** dashboard, use the checkboxes next to the files you want to remove.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Delete">
    The **Delete** button will appear at the top of the list once at least one item is selected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    A confirmation dialog will appear. Click **Confirm Delete** to permanently remove the selected items.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Mass Deletion (Danger Zone)

For large-scale cleanup, Fivemanage offers a powerful **Mass Delete** tool in the Danger Zone. This is useful for clearing out months of old data that is no longer needed.

<Info>
  Mass deletion requires **Owner** permissions for the team.

### How to use Mass Delete

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Danger Zone">
    Go to **Storage** > **Danger Zone** in your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Asset Types">
    Choose which types of media you want to target (Images, Videos, or Audio). You can select one or all of them.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a Date Range">
    Select the start and end dates for the files you want to delete. The system will calculate how many files match your criteria.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm with Team Name">
    To prevent accidental deletion, you must confirm the total count of files before the process begins.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Important Considerations

### Retention Exempt Files
Files marked as **Retention Exempt** will still be deleted if you manually select them for deletion or if they fall within a Mass Deletion date range. Exemption only protects files from *automatic* cleanup policies.

### Bulk Selection Tips
- Use the **Search** bar to find specific groups of files (e.g., by extension or filename) before selecting them for deletion.
- You can filter by **Media Type** to quickly select all videos or all audio files in the current view.
