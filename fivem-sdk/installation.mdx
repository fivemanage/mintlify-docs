## Prerequisites

Before installing the SDK, ensure you have the following:

- A Fivemanage account and API keys (Media and Logs).
- **[screenshot-basic](https://github.com/citizenfx/screenshot-basic)**: Required for capturing client screenshots.

## Installation Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the SDK">
    Obtain the latest release of the Fivemanage SDK from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/fivemanage/sdk/releases/latest). Download the `fmsdk.zip` file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extract to Resources">
    Unzip the `fmsdk.zip` and place the `fmsdk` folder into your FiveM server's `resources` directory.

    <Warning>
      Ensure the folder is named `fmsdk` and is placed directly in the `resources` folder (or a sub-category folder if you prefer, but `fmsdk` must be the resource name).
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    If you don't have `screenshot-basic` installed, download it and add it to your `resources` folder. This is essential for the `takeImage` functionality.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure server.cfg">
    Add the following lines to your `server.cfg`. Ensure `screenshot-basic` starts **before** `fmsdk`.

    ```cfg
    ensure screenshot-basic
    ensure fmsdk
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set API Keys">
    Add your Fivemanage API keys as ConVars in your `server.cfg`:

    ```cfg
    set FIVEMANAGE_MEDIA_API_KEY "your_media_api_key"
    set FIVEMANAGE_LOGS_API_KEY "your_logs_api_key"
    ```

    <Note>
      You only need to set the keys for the features you plan to use.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

After installation, you can further customize the SDK's behavior by editing the `config.json` file located within the `fmsdk` resource folder.
