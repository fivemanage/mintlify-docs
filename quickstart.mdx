## Get started in three steps

Create an account, an API key and start uploading.

### Step 1: Sign up

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create your Fivemanage account" defaultOpen icon="user-crown">
    Head over to [Fivemanage]([https://app.fivemanage.com](https://app.fivemanage.com/)), create your account.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Create your first team" icon="user-group-simple">
    Once you have created your user, you will be able to create a team. Choose the name and the type of team you're creating. Once you've done that, come back here.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Generate a API key

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Install our GitHub app" defaultOpen icon="github">
    Navigate over to [Tokens](https://app.fivemanage.com?to=/dashboard/:teamId/tokens) to create your first token.

    When creating an API key, you can choose between different scopes: 

    1. Images
    2. Videos
    3. Audio
    4. Media (all of the above)
    5. Logs

    Give it a name that breifly explains what it's for.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Go live

<Accordion title="Publish your docs" icon="rocket">
  1. Commit and push your changes.
  2. Your docs will update and be live in moments!
</Accordion>
