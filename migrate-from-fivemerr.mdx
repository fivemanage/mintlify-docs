Fivemerr is shutting down, but you can easily move all your files to Fivemanage using our automated migration tool. This guide will walk you through the process.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. A [Fivemanage account](https://app.fivemanage.com).
2. Created a team on Fivemanage.

## Step 1: Export Data from Fivemerr

First, you need to get the list of your files from Fivemerr.

1. Log in to your **Fivemerr dashboard**.
2. Navigate to the settings or export section.
3. Click on **Export CSV** to download a file containing all your file URLs.

## Step 2: Start Migration on Fivemanage

Once you have your CSV file, head over to Fivemanage.

1. Go to your [Fivemanage Dashboard](https://app.fivemanage.com).
2. Select your team.
3. Navigate to **Storage** \> **Migration**.
4. Drag and drop your Fivemerr CSV file into the upload area.

## Step 3: Review and Migrate

After uploading the CSV, you'll see a preview of the files to be migrated.

- **File Stats**: You'll see the total number of files and their total size.
- **Retention Exemption**: You can choose to **exempt these files from retention policies**. This ensures they are never automatically deleted, even if you enable retention rules later.

Click **Start Migration** to begin the process.

## Step 4: Monitor Progress

The migration runs in the background. You can close the tab and come back later, but staying on the page allows you to monitor progress in real-time.

The status will change from **Queued** to **Processing** as files are downloaded from Fivemerr and uploaded to Fivemanage.

## Important Limits & Notes

### Free Tier & Storage Limits

If you are on the **Free Tier**, you have a 10GB storage limit. However, for this migration:

- **You CAN migrate more than 10GB**: We allow you to migrate your entire Fivemerr library, even if it exceeds the 10GB free limit.
- **Upload Restriction**: Once you exceed the 10GB limit, you will **not be able to upload new files** until you upgrade your plan or delete files to get back under the limit.

<Tip>
  Use code **FIVEMERR50** for 50% off your first month of any paid plan if you need more storage!
</Tip>

### Large Files

Large video files may take longer to process. Our system handles files of any size, but please be patient with larger uploads.

### File URLs

We preserve your original Fivemerr file paths to make the transition as easy as possible. You only need to replace the domain in your scripts or configuration files.

- **Old URL**: `https://files.fivemerr.com/images/example.png`
- **New URL**: `https://r2.fivemanage.com/images/example.png`

Simply find and replace `files.fivemerr.com` with `r2.fivemanage.com` in your codebase, and your files will continue to work seamlessly.
