## Customizing Permissions

While roles provide a starting point, Owners and Admins can fine-tune permissions for individual members.

### Permission Categories

- **Logs:** Control whether a user can read or search team logs.
- **Tokens:** Granular control over reading existing tokens or creating new ones.
- **Integrations:** Permission to modify external connections like Discord bots and webhooks.

<Info>
  **Note on Inheritance:** When you change a member's role, their permissions are automatically updated to the default for that new role. You can then manually toggle specific permissions if needed.
