title: "Presigned URLs"
description: "Presigned URLs is the safest way to upload files through the client. One example is from NUI in FiveM, where you otherwise would expose the token to every client if you're not using a presigned URL, or uploading your files from the server. "

To get a presigned URL, you first need to request for it. Here we'll go through how you'd do it

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request the presigned URL">
    Start by performing a `GET` request on the server. This needs to contain the endpoint and your API token.

    The `?fileType` param can be `image`, `audio` or `video`.

    <Info>
      We plan to remove this `?fileType` param in our next version of the API.

        ```bash
        curl --request GET \
        	--url 'https://fmapi.net/api/v2/presigned-url?fileType=image' \
        	--header 'Authorization: YOUR_API_TOKEN' \
        ```

        You will then get a response that looks like this:

        ```json
        {
        	"data": {
            	"presignedUrl": "https://fmapi.net/api/v2/presigned-url/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
          	},
        	"status": "ok"
        }
        ```

        This is the url that you will be using in order to upload the file.

        const options = {
        	method: 'GET',
        	headers: {
        		'User-Agent': 'YOUR_SERVICE',
        		Authorization: 'YOUR_API_TOKEN'
        	}
        };
        
        fetch('https://fmapi.net/api/v2/presigned-url?fileType=image', options)
        	.then(response => response.json())
            .then(response => console.log(response))
        	.catch(err => console.error(err));
        ```
      </Tab>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Uploading files">
    Once you have this URL, you can then use it to upload a file like you might previously have done, but without a `Authorization` header.
