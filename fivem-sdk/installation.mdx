## Download FMSDK

Start by downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/fivemanage/sdk/releases/latest) from GitHub. Make sure you download `fmsdk.zip` .

Once you've downloaded it, unzip it and drag it to your `/resources/`  directory.

<Warning>
  Make sure you place `fmsdk` in the root of `/resources/` , not inside of a `/resources/[category]` directory.
</Warning>

## Setting up FMDK

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create API Tokens">
    If you haven't already, go to the Fivemanage dashboard and create a `Media` and `Logs`. You will need them configure FMSDK later.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Convars">
    Inside of your `server.cfg` or a `*.cfg` you have, add:

    ```
    set FIVEMANAGE_MEDIA_API_KEY your_media_api_token
    set FIVEMANAGE_LOGS_API_KEY your_logs_api_token
    ```

    <Note>
      You can wrap the API tokens in double quotes (") or leave them be. Single quotes (') will not work.
