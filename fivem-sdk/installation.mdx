## Download FMSDK

Start by downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/fivemanage/sdk/releases/latest) from GitHub. Make sure you download `fmsdk.zip` .

Once you've downloaded it, unzip it and drag it to your `/resources/`  directory.

<Warning>
  Make sure you place `fmsdk` in the root of `/resources/` , not inside of a `/resources/[category]` directory.
