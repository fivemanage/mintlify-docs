description: "Build powerful integrations with the Fivemanage REST API."
---

Welcome to the Fivemanage API reference. Our REST API allows you to programmatically manage your game media, centralize your logs, and integrate our high-performance infrastructure directly into your own applications and game scripts.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to the following base URL:

```http
https://api.fivemanage.com/api/v3
```

## Authentication

The Fivemanage API uses API Keys to authenticate requests. You can generate and manage your API keys from the [Tokens](https://app.fivemanage.com?to=/dashboard/:teamId/token) page in your dashboard.

To authenticate a request, include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Warning>
  Your API keys carry significant privileges. Keep them secure and never share them in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub or client-side code.
</Warning>

## Core Features

## Response Formats

The API returns data in JSON format. Successful requests will typically return a `200 OK` or `201 Created` status code, while errors will return a descriptive error message and an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`).

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "data": {
    "id": "7F9pGhN8qwErT1vx5aZk",
    "url": "https://r2.fivemanage.com/<teamId>/7F9pGhN8qwErT1vx5aZk.jpg"
