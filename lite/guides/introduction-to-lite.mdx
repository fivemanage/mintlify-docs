# Fivemanage Lite

## Introduction

**Fivemanage Lite** is the open-source, self-hosted edition of the Fivemanage platform. It is a lightweight yet powerful backend solution designed specifically for gaming communities (such as FiveM) to handle infrastructure needs without relying on external SaaS providers.

The project is built as a stateless **Go** backend paired with a modern **React** dashboard. It focuses on three core operational pillars:

*   **Media Hosting**: A centralized asset store compatible with S3 providers (AWS, Cloudflare R2, MinIO).
*   **Structured Logging**: High-throughput log ingestion powered by ClickHouse, allowing for real-time searching and filtering of game events.
*   **Multi-Tenant Management**: Built-in support for organizations, members, and API token management.

## Features

Fivemanage Lite comes packed with essential features for community management:

- **Multi-tenant organization support**: Manage multiple groups or communities from a single instance.
- **File storage**: Seamless integration with S3-compatible providers (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO) for handling user uploads and assets.
- **High-performance logging**: Powered by ClickHouse to ingest and query millions of log entries with minimal latency.
- **Authentication**: Built-in session management and secure authentication flows.
- **Observability**: Native OpenTelemetry integration for tracing and performance monitoring.
- **Modern Dashboard**: A responsive, React-based administrative interface for managing your instance.

## Architecture

Fivemanage Lite is designed to be stateless and scalable. It offloads persistence to specialized services, ensuring reliability and performance.

- **Backend**: Written in Go, providing a fast and efficient API.
- **Frontend**: A React application serving as the control plane.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data (users, settings).
- **Log Store**: ClickHouse for high-volume event logging.
- **Object Storage**: S3-compatible API for file persistence.
