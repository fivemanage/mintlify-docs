## Configuring

First open `lb-phone/config/config.lua` and set all upload methods to `Fivemanage`

```lua lb-phone/config/config.lua
Config.UploadMethod.Video = "Fivemanage"
Config.UploadMethod.Image = "Fivemanage"
Config.UploadMethod.Audio = "Fivemanage"
```

Now set the API token you got from Fivemanage in `lb-phone/server/apiKeys.lua`

```lua lb-phone/server/apiKeys.lua
API_KEYS = {
    Video = "YOUR_TOKEN",
    Image = "YOUR_TOKEN",
    Audio = "YOUR_TOKEN",
}
```
