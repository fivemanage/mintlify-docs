Installing the Fivemanage Logger is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to get started.

## Prerequisites

- A Hytale dedicated server.
- Access to your server's `mods` directory.

## Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. Download the Plugin

Download the latest version of the Fivemanage Logger `.jar` file from the [official releases page](https://github.com/fivemanage/hytale-sdk/releases).

### 2. Upload to Server

Place the downloaded `.jar` file into your Hytale server's `mods` directory.

```bash
/your-server-root/
└── mods/
    └── Fivemanage_Logger.jar
```

### 3. Create Configuration Directory

The plugin expects a configuration file in a specific directory. Create a folder named `Fivemanage_Logger` inside your `mods` directory.

### 4. Create Configuration File

Inside the `Fivemanage_Logger` folder, create a file named `config.json`. You can use the [Configuration](/hytale-sdk/configuration) guide to set up your preferred logging provider.

```bash
/your-server-root/
└── mods/
    └── Fivemanage_Logger/
        └── config.json
```

### 5. Restart Server

Restart your Hytale server to load the plugin. Check the server console to verify that the plugin has initialized correctly.

<Note>
  If the plugin is working correctly, you should see a message in the console: `[FivemanageLogger] Initialized with provider: <provider_name>`
